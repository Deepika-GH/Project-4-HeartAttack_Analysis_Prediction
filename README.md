# Overview

## Purpose of the Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual will have the propensity for heart attacks, based on various features provided in the dataset. This analysis involves preprocessing the data, including handling categorical variables, scaling the features, and then training and evaluating a deep learning model (a neural network) to make these predictions. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can help identify individuals that are likely to have heart attacks, which can be valuable to the individual and their families.
