# Overview

## Introduction:

This project serves a dual purpose: firstly, it aims to construct a proficient machine learning model capable of forecasting an individual's susceptibility to heart attacks. Secondly, it seeks to design a user-friendly interface that empowers users to self-assess their risk of experiencing a heart attack. This multifaceted analysis encompasses intricate data preprocessing tasks such as managing categorical variables and feature scaling, followed by the training and evaluation of a deep learning model, specifically a neural network, for these predictive tasks. The ultimate objective is to craft a predictive model that can effectively discern individuals who are at heightened risk of heart attacks, delivering substantial value to both the individuals themselves and their families.
